							Everyone loves bubbles. They’re a favorite outdoor activity on a nice sunny
							day. We can chase them, run through clusters of them, and pop them. They flash
							with beautiful rainbow colors. Bubbles are great!

						What makes up a bubble?
					</a>

					<div class="bub400">
						<p class="text bub">
							Bubbles are made up of two things: soap and water. You can think of a bubble as
							a sandwich of sorts. The two pieces of “bread” consist of soap molecules (a
							group of atoms bonded together). The “meat” of the sandwich is a thin layer of
							water. The soap keeps the water safe and sound; for a while at least. Of course
							we can’t forget that the entire bubble sandwich encloses air.
						</p>

					<h2 class="subtitle bub">
						Why are bubbles always round?
					</h2>

					<div class="bub450 right">
						<p class="text bub">
							Let’s say your bubble wand is shaped like a heart or star. When you create a
							bubble with your wand, it may stretch, but when you seal the bubble, it will
							not be shaped like a heart or star, but a round shape called a sphere. No
							matter what, a single bubble will always try to become a sphere. This is
							because the sphere is the smallest possible shape for the volume of air it
							contains. If a bubble had corners or edges, the soap would be stretched
							unevenly, and therefore would be less efficient because it requires more energy
							to achieve.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2 class="subtitle bub big">
						What causes the rainbow colors to form on bubbles?
					</h2>

					<div class="bub520">
						<p class="text bub">
							The beautiful collection of colors that you see on a bubble are light waves
							reflecting back to your eyes from the outer and inner soap layers. The light
							waves from the two layers interfere with each other. The interference can cause
							certain colors to appear dull or non-existent, while other colors appear more
							vibrant. The colors that you see in a bubble are called interference colors and
							what you see depends on the thickness (which constantly changes) of the soap
							and water layers. Because the layers constantly change, the colors constantly
							change, and no two bubbles will have the same color arrangement.
